# Police Dataset Data Analysis
-----

## Problem Statement

The project aims to analyze a **police dataset** comprising various attributes such as **driver_gender**, **driver_dob**, **driver_age**, **driver_race**, **violation_raw**, **violation**, **search_conducted**, **stop_outcome**, **is_arrested**, **stop_duration**, and **drugs_related_stop**. The objective is to conduct comprehensive **data analysis** and visualize key insights through six distinct graphs using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** libraries.
The analysis encompasses various aspects such as demographic patterns, enforcement trends, and potential biases within the dataset, facilitating deeper understanding and insights into law enforcement practices.

## Aim of the analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand patterns and trends in police stops by examining demographic distributions, violation types, and stop outcomes.
2. **Insight Generation:** Identify potential biases or disparities in law enforcement practices based on gender, race, or age through statistical analysis and visualization.
3. **Inform Policy and Decision Making:** Provide actionable insights to policymakers and law enforcement agencies for improving fairness, transparency, and accountability in traffic enforcement procedures.
